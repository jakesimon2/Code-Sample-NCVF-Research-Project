# Code-Sample-NCVF-Research-Project
This is my code sample from the research project I am conducting for the NCVF. It consists of 2.5 parts out of my 4 part program. The 0.5 part, makes a bar graph out of three cateogories: NCAA Varsity players, CC Varsity Players, and Max Varsity spots. The last part consists of two pie charts and a histogram based on whether or not schools would like a Varsity level division.
